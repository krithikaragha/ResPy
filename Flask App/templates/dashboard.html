        <h5 class="card-title">Tobacco Usage</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
            One hundred million deaths were caused by tobacco in the 20th century, 
            and it is estimated that there will be up to one billion deaths attributed to tobacco 
            use in the 21st century.<br><br>
            To visualize tobacco use, we created four separate choropleth maps that show percentage of everyday 
            smokers, people who smoke somedays, former and non-smokers. We also created a stacked bar chart
            to view all the data at once.

        <h5 class="card-title">Cardiovascular Disease</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
            About 610,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year â€“ that's 1 in 
            every 4 deaths, for both men and women. High blood pressure, high cholestrol and smoking are known to be the key risk 
            factors for heart disease.<br><br>
            To visualize mortality rates caused by cardiovascular disease, we created a simple bar chart that shows
            the average death rate for every state calculated per 100,000 population.

        <p class="card-text">
            Whether you live in a city where smog forecasts are routine or in a less populated 
            place, tiny pollution particles in the air can lead to big problems for your health and quality of life.
            Which is why, tracking air quality becomes very important for obvious reasons.<br><br>
            To visualize air quality data, we plotted a map to show a tile layer containing markers 
            indicating PM2.5 based AQI - the lower the number, the better the air quality.
