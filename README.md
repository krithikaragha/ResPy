![cover_img](Images/cigarette.jpg)

### 1.1 Product Overview
The Respiratory Diseases: Smoking vs. Air Pollution in the United States project will be an inexpensive and easily accessible way to show the data of air pollution and data of smoking/cardiovascular disease in the United States. The application will be designed as a Flask app. The application will make use of Leaflet.js to show maps of the U.S with air quality indices as well as percent of tobacco use by state. The application also makes use of Plotly.js to show levels of mortality rates for cardiovascular diseases. This will allow for the correlation to be created on whether or not areas with larger air pollution have a population with more cardiovascular diseases. 

### 1.2 Data Sources
  1. BRFSS Prevalence and Trends Data: Tobacco Use (https://data.cdc.gov/Smoking-Tobacco-Use/BRFSS-Prevalence-and-Trends-Data-Tobacco-Use-Four-/ya9m-pyut/data)
  2. Air Quality Programmatic APIs (https://aqicn.org/api/)
  3. National Cardiovascular Disease Mortality Rates (https://data.cdc.gov/Heart-Disease-Stroke-Prevention/National-Vital-Statistics-System-NVSS-National-Car/kztq-p2jf)

### 1.3 Objectives
  * Create a html website that has many layers and graphs to portray information and tell a story.
  * Provide users an interactive means to explore data themselves and generate conclusions
  * Use the Tobacco Use data to show how cardiovascular disease mortality rate and smoking are correlated in the United States. 
  * Use data from the Air Quality Programmatic API to show the air pollution 

### 1.4 Technologies
  * Python Flask
  * JavaScript, Plotly.js, Leaflet.js
  * HTML/CSS
